Funky Divas wit a cool light stroll
Sending smooth vibe to all our dear fans
It feels good to be groovin' again

Chocolate cream to me baby, so sweet to me
Like some honey to a honey bee
I am drawn to you baby like a strong magnet, oh
Once I'm there, there's no turning back

There is no real excuse, why take this abuse?
I keep running back, taking smack, don't know
What to say or to do, it's amazing but I act crazy
I can't win, it's a sin, so I feel I have to fight it

Runaway love, like a train on broken tracks
Runaway love, it's too hard to turn it back now
Runaway love, feels good without a doubt, yeah
Runaway love, has to stop before it turns me out

Ooh, I'm not qualified to play love games with you
I've been hurt hard lately, I'm not for being used, no more
Just a little lovin', it's like a drug and I'm a drug addict
I just don't know why I can't let go

I can't walk away, fade away, everyday my love
Grows and grows, it's a sickness or is it weakness
Should I cope? Is there hope? All I know
It's hard to stop a runaway love, ooh baby

Runaway love, runaway love, feels good without a doubt
Runaway love, has to stop before it turns me out

Change, take me, take me, take me higher
I know you can do it, take me higher
Take me higher, take me higher, take me

Runaway love, runaway love, feels good without a doubt
Runaway love, has to stop before it turns me out

Runaway love, like a train on broken tracks
Runaway love, it's too hard to turn it back now
Runaway love, feels good without a doubt, yeah
Runaway love, has to stop before it turns me out
