The bar, the dip, the woo
Though the words are true
The state is old news

Wrap me in your arms
I can't feel it but
Wrap me in your arms

Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Feel the turn of rotation
And stop, see the next one waiting
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Get up
Sentiment's the same but the pair of feet change

I know my words will dry upon the skin
Just like a name I remember hearing
Wild winter, warm coffee
Mom's gone, do you love me?
Blazing summer, cold coffee
Baby's gone, do you love me?

Wrap me in your arms
I can't feel it but
Wrap me in your arms
I can't feel it but

Get up, get down
Get up, get down

And when I come home again
My arms will wrap around my friends 
My arms will wrap around my friends 
I'm covered in soot
I'm covered in skin
And when I go to leave again I'll wear the clothes you put me in
And when I go to leave again I'll wear the clothes you put me in
Could I be coming home 
With the waves rolling back

Oh why?
Oh why did I go outside with the bitches on the trail oh why? 
Oh why? Did I go,
I don't know
Only thing I can think to say is get on the train
Get on the train
And ride it till you come
Ride it till you come
Or could I just
Get on the train get on the train and ride it till you come.
Ride it till you come

Like the bass child
Like the river wild
Like the tide coming in again
We're driving the van
Through dotted lines we're making friends
With all the other bands
Driving to make their fortunes.
Could I be coming home
With the waves rolling back
With the waves rolling back
With the waves rolling back

We're chasing the glow
A pack of wolves
We're running from home to home
Blindly searching for what we know (a dream created from the videos)
Our feet are getting raw,
But our mouths still quietly
Sing the song
Keeping time to piston rods
We're feeding ourselves on steam exhaust

Oh why?
Oh why?
Do I run like the wolf each time my roots peak out from tender foot
Oh why, oh why
Can't I just kiss my lips enough
Be happy with just making love?",290,oh

Find some hand to hold
Let the car coast with no lights

Moon in the window and girls on the floor 
Ohweeohweeoh kids movie so slow
Duds wrapped around each other drinking up the sweet and water
Ohweeohweeoh kids movie so slow
Jump a cross a river got a long way to go
Ohweeohweeoh kids move so slow
It's the smallest water pile dreamy bruises sweet lovers 
And they say I want you(you) 
To see all the ways I can move
To see how a skin so smooth 
See how my blood runs blue
Pull out the hand that moves you
It's the heart beat don't fight
Let your limbs flare in the mood
Like your a wild thing doing right
How can we question 
What we knows feels right
Black eyes turn to marigolds
In the morning light
Ohweeohweeoh kids move so slow 
Shaken all over like some dogs at the pool
Ohweeohweeoh kids move so slow 
There kicken all the records over acting like they hanging water
Ohweeohweeoh kids move so slow
Down in the basement where the sun don't show

Naked dollars wonder piles dreamy bruises rotten lovers
And they say I want you(you)
To bend me back in two
To make me sing your tune

But oh you look like a morning star, to see who we are, oooooo

You look good in the south, see how you use your mouth
You look good in the east, all elbows and knees
To the honey dipper, to the sound shifter
Oh dont you know you want to
See that moonrise in the rear view
Just like you had wanted it to
Temperature drops, the hot tart cools
Ready oh the radio calling to you
Right out loud she said it
For crying out loud they meant it
Sing that song like i know you can
Work your jaw like a blind man
Call like call like you own the land throw up your hands, make demands
You look good in the west, see how you clap those hands
You look good in the south, see how you use your mouth
You look good in the east, all elbows and knees
To the honey dipper, to the sound shifter?
You look good in the north, whip your hair back and forth
You look good in the east, door, the wall, move your feet
You look good in the south, make your makers proud
You look good in the west, you look good in a dress

Sylvan Esso,What Now [2017],Signal,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33904682/Sylvan+Esso/Signal,"Little birdie making car alarm sounds
In the tree next to your house
Little baby know to smile for the picture
Then go back to drawing that flower
And a smokey chimney too
And an arrow pointing at their room
And the stars above
Was that a satellite you drew, my love?

It's a signal in the noise
It's a bell in a mine
It's a black dog in a junkyard
Gonna chase you down in time
Chase you down in time

Can you catch up to the cars on the highway?
Run them down
Can you throw yourself off of an airplane?
Breath ripped out
While you showboat
While you slow float
While the Earth gets large and loud
Are you breathing now?
Here's the ground

Don't you want to catch you
Don't you want to catch you
Make you feel your pulse
Make your feet fly
Don't you want to catch you
Don't you want to catch you
Drag you down in the dirt
Make you feel alive

It's a signal in the noise
It's a bell in a mine
It's a black dog in a junkyard
Gonna chase you down in time

It's a signal in the noise
It's a bell in a mine
It's a black dog in a junkyard
Gonna chase you down in time

(It's a signal in the noise
It's a bell in a mine
It's a black dog in a junkyard
Gonna chase you down in time)",245,chase
Sylvan Esso,What Now [2017],Slack Jaw,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33904681/Sylvan+Esso/Slack+Jaw,"I got all the parts I wished for
I've got everything I need
Sometimes I'm above water
But mostly I'm at sea

Oh, slack jawed me
Can't you see?
There's so many rhythms and harmonies
And I'm walking the dog back

It's not like I got hurt or broken
Or ruined on the way
It's an ache and it shines through me
A swallow in a cage

Oh, slack jawed me
Can't you see?
There's so many rhythms and harmonies
And I'm walking the dog back

Is it a sign? Or just a landmine?
Or a feeling roaming free?
It's overtaken me
Gonna hold it 'til it dries up
Or pocket it for another day
If it's me I cannot give up
I'd rather that she stayed

Oh, slack jawed me
Can't you see?
There's so many rhythms and harmonies
And I'm walking the dog back

I got all the parts I've wished for
I got everything I need
Sometimes I'm above water
But mostly I'm at sea

Oh, slack jawed me
Can't you see?
There's so many rhythms and harmonies
And I'm walking the dog back",187,i'm

I'll fall all over myself trying
I try until I build it up, I
Pretend 'til it's real enough, 'cause
I was made to act it out
I was made to twist and shout, oh
I was made to be the one you
Thought you remembered from the song

Yes, I'm the song that you can't get out of your head, oh
I'm the song that's bringing you to bed
I'm the song that's promising you all your wants
And needs and needs and needs and needs
Oh, how you want it to be real and it can be
Oh, if you only live in me, it can be
Oh, if you only live in me

Gimme the thing that I saw once when
I was younger and hadn't had enough when
All I knew of bad love
Was in a page in a board room full of grown ups
'Cause I can feel how it feels
Even though it isn't real
It's living on the tip of my tongue
I listened to it forever once

Yes, I'm the song that you can't get out of your head, oh
I'm the song that's bringing you to bed
I'm the song that's promising you all your wants
And needs and needs and needs and needs
Oh, how you want it to be real, and it can be
Oh, if you only live in me, it can be
Oh, if you only live in me, it can be

Sylvan Esso,Another Friday Night/Hot Heavy Summer/Sister [2018],Hot Heavy Summer,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35480291/Ben+Howard/Hot+Heavy+Summer,"Baby wants to dance
Past the flat footed charterhouse boys
From towns where the mothers can't stand
The sight of each other
Baby wants to last
In the hearts of the wild and free
She knows that time takes all of us
Through every long hot heavy summer

And all of them, they talk of national security
Over garden fences made to buff the bastard breeze
Of chance encounters

Baby wants to dance
Past the Tuesday morning supermarket crowd
She knows we'll all sleep through the days
And be two-step drip fed our laughter
Says she wants to last
Last how you want to
She's a light in the young boy's eyes
Through every long hot heavy summer

And all of them, they talk of national security
Over garden fences made to buff the bastard breeze
Yeah all of them, shuffling down that lonely street
One last gasp
Against a long hot heavy summer",154,wants

Gas station is running dry
Mhm, eh eh, mhm
Sweaty, sweaty, wonder why
Now it's always summer time
Mhm, eh eh, mhm

It's all gone but here we're gonna stay
Anyway the concrete's all empty
So we're making a parade
It goes left, nothing there
It goes right, watch your step
It goes left, don't look down
It goes right, look straight ahead
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead
Maybe there's some food up there

P-A-R-A-D with me
Yeah there's nothing left to ruin, yeah we finally got free
How's that for manifesting our destiny
P-A-R-A-D with me

Salty, salty, water dried
Oceans all gone with the tide
Mhm, eh eh, mhm
Steamy, steamy, bright sunshine
Flowers, grass and trees all died
Mhm, eh eh, mhm

It's all gone but here we're gonna stay
